Hi!

Our system is primarily tested by observing the output on utop. To be able to run
the system, the OCaml packages yojson and ANSITerminal need to be available, 
which, if not already installed, can be done using the following commands through
OPAM in the terminal (or WSL, if Windows is the core OS):

(DO NOT prefix these commands with sudo)
$ opam install -y utop yojson ansiterminal merlin ocp-indent user-setup bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild
$ opam user-setup install

The above commands, of course, assume that OPAM has been installed on the computer.

Before attempting to use the code, it is necessary to run "make build" so that 
the system can be used on utop. Following this, to use the "Card" module (which
contains the primary user functionality for now), the following commands must be
entered in utop:

#require "yojson";;
#use "card.ml";;
print_money_cards(get_money());;

The last command gives an ANSITerminal representation of the money cards available
as part of the game. Action cards have also been made available, and as of this
submission, individual rent cards are being configured.

Finally, the json_formation_util.ml file was used to generate the card_data.json
representation of the cards in the game. It is not really necessary to execute 
this file, since the json has already been created, but it made our lives simpler!
