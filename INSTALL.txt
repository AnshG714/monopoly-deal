Hi!

Our multi player system is primarily used on the terminal of a single user.
To be able to runthe system, the OCaml packages yojson and ANSITerminal need to 
be available, which, if not already installed, can be done using the following 
commands through OPAM in the terminal (or WSL, if Windows is the core OS):

(DO NOT prefix these commands with sudo)
$ opam install -y utop yojson ansiterminal merlin ocp-indent user-setup bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild
$ opam user-setup install

The above commands, of course, assume that OPAM has been installed on the computer.

Before attempting to use the code, it is necessary to run "make build" so that 
the system can be used on utop. Running "make test" will execute the test cases,
and "make docs" will extract all documentation across files in our codebase.

To play the game, run "make play". A series of guided prompts walk you through the 
initial setup and can be used to target errors in playing the game. A full set of 
the rules used in the game can be found here: http://monopolydealrules.com/

Finally, the json_formation_util.ml file was used to generate the card_data.json
representation of the cards in the game. It is not really necessary to execute 
this file, since the json has already been created, but it made our lives simpler!
